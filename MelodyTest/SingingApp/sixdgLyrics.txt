Title: Six Degrees
of Separation
Artist: The Script

You've read the books
You've watched 
the shows
What's the best way?
No one knows ye
Ye meditate
Get hypnotized
Anything to take 
it from your mind
But it won't go
You're doing all 
these things out 
of desperation

Oooohh
Oooohh

You're going 
through six degrees 
of separation
Ye hit a drink
Ye take a talk
Watch the past 
go up in smoke
Ye fake a smile
Ye lie and say:
You're better 
now than ever
And your life's okay
Well it's not, 
no ooohh
You're doing all 
these things out 
of desperation

Oooohh
Oooohh

You're going through 
six degrees of 
separation

First, you think 
the worst is
a broken heart
What's gonna kill
you is the second part
And the third,
is when your world
splits down the middle
Fourth, you're gonna
think that you
fixed yourself
Fifth, you see
them out with
someone else
And the sixth,
is when you admit
that you may have
messed up a little
