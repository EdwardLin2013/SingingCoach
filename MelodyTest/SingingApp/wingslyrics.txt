Title: Wings
Artist: Birdy


Sunlight comes 
creeping in
Illuminates our skin
We watch the 
day go by
Stories of all we did
It made me 
think of you
It made me 
think of you

Under a trillion stars
We danced on top 
of cars
Took pictures 
of the stage
So far from where we are
They made me 
think of you
They made me 
think of you

Oh lights go down
In the moment 
we're lost and found
I just wanna be 
by your side
If these wings could fly
For the rest of our lives
