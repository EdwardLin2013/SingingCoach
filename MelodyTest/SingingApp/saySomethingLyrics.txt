Title: Say Something
Artist: A Great
Big World

Say something, 
I'm giving up on you

I'll be the one, 
if you want me to

Anywhere I would've 
followed you

Say something, 
I'm giving up on you

And I 
am feeling so small

It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will 
stumble and fall
I'm still learning 
to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something, 
I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that 
I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would've 
followed you
Say something, 
I'm giving up on you
