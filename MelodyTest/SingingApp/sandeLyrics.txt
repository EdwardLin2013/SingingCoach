Title: Beneath Your
Beautiful
Artist: Labrinth ft.
Emily Sande

You tell all 
the boys "no"
Makes you
feel good, yeah
I know you're
out of my league
But that won't
scare me away,
oh no

You've carried
on so long
You couldn't
stop if you
tried it

You've built
your wall so high
That no one
could climb it
But i'm
gonna try

Would you let me
see beneath
your beautiful
Would you let me
see beneath
your perfect
Take it off
now girl, take it
off now girl
I wanna see inside
Would you let me
see beneath
your beautiful tonight
