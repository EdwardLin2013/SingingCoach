Party girls 
don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, 
when will I learn
I push it down, 
push it down
I'm the one 
"for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, 
they're ringin' 
my doorbell
I feel the love, 
feel the love

1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink

Throw 'em back, 
'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing 
from the chandelier,
from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like 
tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a 
bird through the night,
feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing 
from the chandelier,
from the chandelier
